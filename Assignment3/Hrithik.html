                    <p class="card-text">Hrithik Roshan born 10 January 1974, is an Indian actor who works in Hindi films. He has portrayed a variety of characters and is known for his dancing skills. One of the highest-paid actors in India, he has won many awards, including six Filmfare Awards, of which four were for Best Actor. Starting from 2012, he has appeared in Forbes India's Celebrity 100 several times based on his income and popularity. Roshan has frequently collaborated with his father, Rakesh Roshan. He made brief appearances as a child actor in several films in the 1980s and later worked as an assistant director on four of his father's films. His first leading role was in the box-office success Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai (2000), for which he received several awards. Performances in the 2000 terrorism drama Fiza and the 2001 ensemble family drama Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham... consolidated his reputation but were followed by several poorly received films. The 2003 science fiction film Koi... Mil Gaya, for which Roshan won two Filmfare Awards, was a turning point in his film career; he later starred as the titular superhero in its sequels: Krrish (2006) and Krrish 3 (2013). He earned praise for his portrayal of a thief in Dhoom 2 (2006), Mughal emperor Akbar in Jodhaa Akbar (2008) and a quadriplegic in Guzaarish (2010). He achieved further commercial success by playing the lead in the 2011 drama Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara, the 2012 revenge drama Agneepath, the 2014 action thriller Bang Bang!, the 2019 biopic Super 30, and the 2019 action thriller War; the lattermost ranks as his highest-grossing release</p>
